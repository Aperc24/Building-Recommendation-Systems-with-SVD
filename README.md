# Movie Recommendation System using SVD

This project demonstrates the creation of a movie recommendation system using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique.

## Workflow

The workflow for this project includes:

1. **Importing necessary libraries**  
   Setting up the environment by importing all required libraries.

2. **Loading the dataset**  
   Bringing in the movie dataset for analysis and modeling.

3. **Data pre-processing**  
   Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and model building.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyzing the data to uncover insights and trends.

5. **Building the recommendation model using SVD**  
   Applying the SVD technique to create a robust recommendation system.

6. **Evaluating the model's performance**  
   Assessing the effectiveness of the model using suitable evaluation metrics.

7. **Using the trained model to generate personalized recommendations**  
   Leveraging the trained model to recommend movies tailored to user preferences.
